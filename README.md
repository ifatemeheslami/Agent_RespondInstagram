Instagram Auto-Reply AI Bot

This Python-based AI project leverages the OpenAI ChatGPT API to automatically generate intelligent, context-aware replies to comments on Instagram posts. It detects the language, tone, and intent of each comment and responds in a way that aligns with the brand’s identity and communication guidelines.
The solution is packaged as a simple and intuitive web app using Streamlit, making it easy for non-technical users (e.g., clients or marketing teams) to interact with and manage the automated reply system.
Tech Stack:
– Python
– OpenAI API (ChatGPT)
– Streamlit
– (Optionally: instagrapi or other Instagram API wrappers, if used)

Ideal for:
Developers and collaborators interested in NLP, social media automation, conversational AI, and building brand-aware intelligent assistants.
